## Issues
If you want to showcase a project you've made with this library, create an Issue with the **Showcase** label.
Other than that issues are purely for bugs, if you're having an implementation issue, please send a message in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/e2XwPNTBBr).

## New Fork
This project is a continuation of the original TikTokLiveSharp-Library by sebheron. The original project can be found on [Github](). The Readme for that project can also be found [here](README_ORIGINAL.MD).

As the original Project did not seem to be receiving any new updates, and all the existing TikTokLive-Libraries were lacking in their Messaging-Schema's, this fork involved a re-write of large portions of the original. The original Messaging-Schema has been completely replaced, which can lead to breaking changes. Upgrade to this Library at your own discretion.

## Details
A C# port of the TikTok Live connector library.
Other available versions include:

- [TikTok-Live-Connector](https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Live-Connector) - Node.js Library (by zerodytrash)
- [GoTikTokLive](https://github.com/Davincible/gotiktoklive) - Go Library (by David Brouwer)
- [TikTokLive](https://github.com/isaackogan/TikTokLive) - Python Library (by Isaac Kogan)

The primary incentive behind this library was to update the existing TikTokLive-Library with anew Messaging-Schema and additional Exception-Handling. It's implemented in .NET Standard and should work universally across all .NET supported platforms. An older version of Protobuf-net was used to ensure Unity compatibility.

## Contributing
### How can I help?
As the TikTokLive-Libraries all use reverse engineering to create their own Protobuf-Schema, much is still unknown about many of the Event-Types and Data-Values. If you think you can contribute, please join the Discord-server or create an issue.

### Downloading the Source
This repo is set up in a way so that both TikTokLiveSharp and TikTokLiveUnity can use the exact same main repo. It uses GitIgnore-files in order to separate out these files to the correct subset for each version.
To reduce main to the subset for your version, combine the [Base.gitignore](Base,gitignore) with the file for the Library (either [TikTokLiveSharp](TikTokLiveSharp.gitignore) or [TikTokLiveUnity](TikTokLiveUnity.gitignore) and apply the result to the base [GitIgnore](.gitignore).
If any conflicts remain after creating the gitignore, delete everything in the Repo-Folder and discard that deletion.
